### Categories

Each savestate has a label to separate it into 1 of 4 categories. These include:

- IL: Full segment practice. Savestates will put you in different places than the names, but this is so you can trigger the end of the previous split for use with LiveSplit (i.e. "IL - Watcher Knights" will put you in front of the chandelier so you can break it)
- Movement: Slightly trimmed versions of IL savestates focusing on long stretches of movement without having to go through things like Dreamer cutscenes. In some cases, the Movement savestate would be identical to the IL savestate (i.e. "Movement - Greenpath" vs "IL - Mothwing Cloak"). These have not been included in Movement to avoid redundancy
- Trick: Specific, identifiable parts of the run that are themselves trimmed from Movement. Essentially "glitchless glitches", if you like (i.e. E-Pogo, Shade Skip, etc.)
- Boss: Boss fights and minibosses like VK and Petra Arena

A full set of 162 savestates, with each corresponding to an IL in the RoomSoB sheet posted above. Note that each one will put you in the room/event before the one listed in the savestate's title so that you can time them properly. Some may be confusing, some examples being:

- Shade Skip, which requires that you die to the husks first
- Dream Plats, which requires you to interact with the altar first
- Seer Skip Drop, which requires that you do seer skip first, which means you need to start by picking up the dream nail

Hopefully the reasons for these stranger savestates become apparent when you try to time stuff with them.
